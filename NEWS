VERSION 0.98.1 - Initial release.
  This version is sufficient to run a single Lambda at reduced speed.

  KNOWN ISSUES:
  * The need-fetch bit is inoperative. Every macroinstruction causes a fetch.
    This incurs a heavy speed penalty.
  * SM clock stepping is incomplete, meaning many debugging and diagnostic
    functions will fail.
  * Cache is not implemented. This also incurs a speed penalty.

VERSION 0.98.2
  This version is sufficient to run a single Lambda at reduced speed.

  IMPROVEMENTS:
  * The need-fetch mechanism is now working properly, as far as we can tell.
  * The RTC's RAM is now saved between runs, making it possible to change
    the site timezone without Lisp complaining
  * In situations where both Linux tuntap and BPF are available,
    tuntap is used. This prevents a conflict.
  * The telnet socket used for the SDU serial port has SO_REUSEADDR set.

  KNOWN ISSUES:
  * SM clock stepping is incomplete, meaning many debugging and diagnostic
    functions will fail.
  * Cache is not implemented. This incurs a speed penalty.

VERSION 0.98.3
  This version is sufficient to run a single Lambda in real-time
  on a sufficiently fast machine.

  IMPROVEMENTS:
  * There have been many bug fixes.
  * Many items have been made configurable.
  * Support for physical LMI keyboards on serial interfaces has been added.
  * Tools for manipulating disk images, including a FUSE-based LMFS driver,
    were added.
  * A new YAML-based configuration replaced the old configuration file.
  * The documentation was Markdown-ified.

  KNOWN ISSUES:
  * SM clock stepping is still incomplete, meaning some debugging and
    diagnostic functions will fail. Most seen in the normal operation
    of the system work as intended.
  * Cache is still not implemented, which incurs a speed penalty
    when the Lambda must wait for the bus.
